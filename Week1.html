  <h3>Math</h3>
  <p>Worked on absolute value and scientific notation. Learned to compare very large numbers and very small numbers using scientific notation. Reviewed math vocab, integers, whole numbers, less than, greater than.
    Used <a href="https://www.time4learning.com/">Time4Learning</a> to develop initial curriculum.
  </p>
  <h3>English</h3>
  <p>Using Time4Learning introduced new vocabulary words, briefly worked on connotation, denotation, and synonyms. Started to do research for an explanatory paper on Tigers. Discussed different types of paper and purposes of writing as well as,
    developing a <em>thesis</em>statement. </p>
  <h3>Vocab Words</h3>
    <ul>
    <li class=vocab>Belligerent</li>
    <li class=vocab>Cantankerous</li>
    <li class=vocab>Despondent</li>
    <li class=vocab>Catalyst</li>
    <li class=vocab>Catastrophic</li>
    <li class=vocab>Ethical</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Science</h3>
  <p>Carbon, Nitrogen and Water cycles. Worked through guided notes on Time4Learning and reviewed topics with <a href="https://www.brainpop.com/">BrainPop</a> quizzes and videos. Trinity is designing a project to demonstrate understanding of all
    three cycles. Completed Earth’s Spheres lessons, which was mainly review from last year. </p>

  <h3>Social Studies</h3>
  <p>
    Worked through some of the lessons on Time4Learning and was not super impressed with the curriculum. Trinity did not have history or social studies in the 7th grade, because of this, working with her homeroom teacher to set up a more tailored
    plan to see what holes need to be reviewed to move onto the 8th grade curriculum.
  </p>

  <h3>Electives/Other</h3>
  <p>
    Started Minecraft class with creating a design on the roof of a building, and is working on a paper-craft pixel project. Created first animation for 3D design (featured project). Trinity is still working on sign language and is working on scheduling an
    appointment to work with the homeroom teacher, who knows how to sign. As a fun “extra” activity went to complete an escape room, working on logical thinking and problem solving, she did a great job!
