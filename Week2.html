  <h3>Math</h3>
  <p>Took a break from Scientific Notation and worked on single and multiple step variable equations. Reviewed the rules of positive/negative numbers and how inverse operations work. Completed a 6 Clues project in which Trinity used equations
    to "decode" a word to solve for a prize. Are going to work on creating a poster laying out all of the rules we reviewed. Going to continue working on exponents and fractions.
