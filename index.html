  <p>Combine lack of understanding with a lack of interest and you create the perfect homeschool environment. This year we are trading in traditional brick and mortar schooling for homeschool adventures. There will be no more sitting in the back of
    the class silently failing. This year will (hopefully) encourage the kid to remember that learning is not only fun, but a life skill. Goals include increasing confidence by reviewing and understanding basic concepts and learning how to learn.
    a 13-year-old who has zero interest in evolving our species. Her interests, at this point in time, are limited to Anime, YouTube, and TikTok. This particular human has been struggling in school since about the 1st grade and while she could easily
    tell you the name of every teen in her grade level, could not recall even a single academic activity that occurred during her day. Questions about curriculum and assignments were met with replies of , “How should I know?”, the occasional, “I
    don’t know”, and the ever popular, “I am going to my room”.</p>

  <p>I figured I could take a “practice what you preach” approach and am learning about web development and figured this website would be a great way to show what we are both learning. So follow along with us as we succeed and falter through this
    year, although this is only the beginning I am really looking forward to seeing what we can create. </p>

  <h2>Enrollment Information</h2>
  <p>Trinity is currently enrolled with <a href="https://techtrepacademy.com/">Idaho Tech Trep Academy</a> through the Oneida school district. She takes basic courses at her own pace and has a homeroom teacher that we have contact with at least every two weeks to submit examples of what we
    are working on. She is taking a Minecraft class and 3D Design as electives and does both of those at her own pace, with a teacher available if needed. Our curriculum is based on Tech Trep’s Power Learning Goals, which helps us know what direction
    we need to be headed in. I will link resources and websites below in the Weekly section as we go. </p>
